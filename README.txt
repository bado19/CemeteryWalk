The program can be compiled and run using the make command

The arrow keys will move the view and 0 will reset the view

The light orb distance is adjusted with v/V
adjust the height or the orb with [ or ]
the diffuse can be adjusted with D/d the ambien with A/a the shininess with n/N the specular and emission with s/S and e/E respectivelly

The scene is an abandoned town with a few ruined houses and various tombstones and unmarked graves
in the scene there are various trees with no leves while the terrain is covered with yellow leaves from the trees
On the upper left corner is a grave square where the demons will head to and on the upper right is a structure with spinning blocks of concrete(my intention was to make another creature)

to change view modes use the p button and zoom in and out with - and +

There are green will-0-wisps around the door which opens once you are near the door(collision detection).

when in first person mode(the intended play mode) use AWSD to move around and the arrow keys to look around. The spacebar raises the eye height to create a flying effect.

Thank you for your patience and your help this semester.
